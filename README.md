# http-server-from-scratch

My solution to ["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

I've tried building express-like HTTP server on top of raw tcp server. Quite liked this challenge.

You can see what a mess it used to be in `app/old_main.ts` and what came out of it in `app/main.ts`.

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ bun install
```

Run the code:

```bash
$ bun run dev
```
